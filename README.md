# Hands on JS!
A hands-on JavaScript workshop for a lecture at BSc School of Informatics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. The workshop is co-presented with esteemed colleague [Christos Balaktsis](https://github.com/balaktsis/) as part of the [Web Information Systems](http://qa.auth.gr/en/x/class/1/600271336/) course (Spring 2024-2025).

# Goal
Build a To-do application, powered by JavaScript, offering the following functionality:
- Define To-dos;
- Search and Filter To-dos;
- Hide/Unhide To-dos;
- Mark them as completed.
